My work revolves around extracting valuable insights from complex datasets related to geothermal energy. In my professional journey, I have found a particular affinity for the programming language C.

Outside of my professional endeavors, I find great excitement in exploring the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. This powerful combination of technologies enables me to develop dynamic web applications with a focus on speed, scalability, and user experience. I am constantly sharpening my skills in this tech stack, eager to build innovative solutions that push the boundaries of what can be achieved. When I'm not immersing myself in data analysis or honing my programming skills, I enjoy taking on side projects to further enhance my expertise.
